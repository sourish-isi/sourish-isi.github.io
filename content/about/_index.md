Hola Amigos!! Sourish here !!

I'm an accomplished data scientist with a strong foundation in algorithmic thinking, machine learning, and combinatorial optimization. I earned my Bachelor of Technology in Information Technology from West Bengal University of Technology in 2021 and am currently pursuing a Master of Science at the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), with graduation expected in 2026. From 2021 to 2024, I worked at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) as a Data Scientist, where I focused on developing advanced machine learning models.

Beyond my professional journey, I have a deep passion for creative expression and cultural interests. I enjoy recitation and writing poetry, drawing inspiration from the rhythm and depth of language. I'm also a keen enthusiast of card games, which I value for their strategic and analytical dimensions — a perfect complement to my analytical mindset.

Football is another significant part of my life. I’m an avid follower of the sport, captivated by its global spirit and the artistry in every match. I passionately support Real Madrid and the Brazil national team, admiring their rich histories, dynamic styles of play, and the legendary players who have shaped the beautiful game.

Music holds a special place in my heart as well. I have a deep appreciation for “Gan” — a genre that encompasses Bengali band songs, traditional folk tunes, and popular band music from Bangladesh. This vibrant musical heritage connects me to my cultural roots and continually broadens my creative perspective.
